# Browsr

A web file browsr experiment from mid 2016.

I took the idea from http://codepen.io/znak/pen/ntsdy


I planned to complete the buttons and to add others view options such as icon view, coverflow like, etc.
But… I haven't got the time to.


	The interface is an hommage to Apple Yosemite Finder. (© Apple & everything…)
